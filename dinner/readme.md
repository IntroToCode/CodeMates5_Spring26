### Steps for preparation:

1. Marinate the chicken: In a large bowl or gallon-sized zip-top bag, combine the chicken pieces, buttermilk, hot sauce, and 1 tablespoon of salt. Refrigerate for at least 4 hours, or ideally overnight, to tenderize the meat.

2. Prepare the coating: In a separate large shallow dish, whisk together the flour, the remaining tablespoon of salt, black pepper, garlic powder, onion powder, paprika, and cayenne pepper.

3. Dredge the chicken: Remove each piece of chicken from the buttermilk, letting the excess drip off. Place the chicken in the flour mixture and coat thoroughly, pressing the flour onto the skin to ensure it sticks. For extra crunch, dip it back in the buttermilk and flour a second time.

4. Heat the oil: Pour the oil into a large cast-iron skillet or deep pot until it is about 2 inches deep. Heat over medium-high until it reaches 350°F (175°C).

5. Fry the chicken: Working in batches (do not crowd the pan), carefully place chicken pieces into the hot oil. Fry the dark meat (legs and thighs) for about 12–15 minutes and white meat (breasts and wings) for about 8–10 minutes, turning once, until the internal temperature reaches 165°F (74°C).

6. Drain and rest: Remove the chicken from the oil and place it on a wire cooling rack set over a baking sheet. Let it rest for 5–10 minutes before serving to keep the crust intact.

### Notes:

Temperature Control: If the oil gets too hot, the outside will burn before the inside is cooked. If it’s too cool, the chicken will be greasy. Use a meat thermometer to be safe!

Double Dredge: For those "extra crunchy" bits, drizzle 2 tablespoons of buttermilk into your flour mixture and mix it with a fork before dredging to create small clumps of batter.

Oil Choice: Peanut oil is preferred for its high smoke point and neutral flavor, but vegetable or canola oil works perfectly well too.
