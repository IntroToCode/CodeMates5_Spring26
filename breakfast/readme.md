### Ingredients:
2.5 cups all-purpose flour
3 tablespoons sugar
1 teaspoons baking powder
0.5 teaspoons cardamom (ground)
0.3 teaspoons salt
3 eggs
2 cups milk
6 tablespoons butter (melted)
1 teaspoons vanilla extract


### Steps for preparation:

1. Mix dry ingredients: In a large bowl, whisk together 2.5 cups all-purpose flour, 3 tablespoons sugar, 1 teaspoons baking powder, 0.5 teaspoons cardamom (ground), and 0.3 teaspoons salt.
2. Mix wet ingredients: In a separate bowl, whisk 3 eggs, 2 cups milk, 6 tablespoons butter (melted), and 1 teaspoons vanilla extract together until combined.
3. Combine and rest: Pour the wet ingredients into the dry and stir until you have a smooth, pourable batter. Let it rest for 10–15 minutes
4. Cook the waffles: Heat your waffle iron and lightly butter it. Pour in enough batter to fill the iron (Norwegian waffle irons make heart shapes). Cook until golden and crispy, about 3–3m 30s
5. Serve: Serve warm with sour cream and strawberry jam, or brunost (brown cheese) for a truly Norwegian experience.

### Notes:

My grandmother used to make these for me (Christian after school so they bring such a special childhood nostalgia for me. One thing to note, Cardamom is the key spice that gives Norwegian waffles their distinctive flavor — don't skip it! A heart-shaped waffle iron is traditional, but any iron works. Leftover waffles can be folded in half and eaten as a sandwich with fillings.
