### Ingredients:

1 ball pizza dough (sourdough preferred)  
1 cup tomato sauce  
2 cups shredded mozzarella cheese  
1/2 cup ricotta cheese  
1 cup seasonal vegetables (e.g., mushrooms, spinach, zucchini)

### Steps for preparation:

1. Preheat the oven to 475°F (245°C).
2. Roll out the pizza dough on a lightly floured surface until thin and evenly shaped.
3. Spread the tomato sauce evenly over the dough, leaving a small border around the edges.
4. Sprinkle mozzarella and dollop ricotta across the surface.
5. Evenly distribute the seasonal vegetables on top.
6. Drizzle with olive oil and season lightly with salt.
7. Bake for 12–15 minutes, or until the crust is golden and crisp.
8. Remove from the oven, let cool slightly, slice, and serve warm.

### Notes:

Cheeseboard is famous for offering only one vegetarian pizza flavor per day. Feel free to rotate toppings based on seasonal produce.
